I believe and hope that being an accredited journalist affiliated with TckTckTck and attending Copenhagen would be a catalyst to multiply readership via promotion of my participation. I am sure no one else from my rejoin will be attending. In addition global networking connections will provide an opportunity to broaden the audience and impact.
